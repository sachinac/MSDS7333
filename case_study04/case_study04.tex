\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\textbf{Influenza} most commonly known as \textbf{flu} is an infectious
respiratory disease caused by virus. There four known variants of the
Influenza. Type A , Type B, Type C and Type D. Based on historical data
it occurs in winter or in monsoon season. There are several studies have
been conducted on the causes of occurring in the specific season and one
of the study has linked it to vitamin D levels in human
\protect\hyperlink{references}{\(^{[1]}\)}. It's during winter or rainy
season when people stay mostly indoors and are less expose to sun
causing the fall of levels of vitamin D in people. Staying inside homes
has also been seen as one of the reason of transmission the disease as
people are in close contact of each other. That explains a bit of
seasonal occurrence of the flu every year. These viruses infect nose,
throat and lungs and leads to mild to severe illness and has been
observed that it can also lead to death of proper attention is not
given.

Data shows that globally on an average 389K deaths occurs due to flu and
it mostly affect people who are above 60 years of
age\protect\hyperlink{references}{\(^{[2]}\)}. In the United States
alone more than 200K hospitalization are due to Influenza every
year\protect\hyperlink{references}{\(^{[3]}\)}.
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/}{Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}
has reported range of death is between 3500 and 49K every year and costs
the U.S. economy more than \$10
billions\protect\hyperlink{references}{\(^{[4]}\)}.Out of many strains
of the viruses few have potential to create pandemics/epidemics. One the
deadliest pandemic occurred in year 1918 which infected 33\% of the
world population and caused 100 million deaths worldwide. It has been
observed that such or less severe pandemic occurs 3 times in a century.
As this is repeating phenomenon it becomes important to gather data on
infection to take precautionary steps to contain the impact of virus to
protect most vulnerable population. It helps to control and respond
proactively to spread of the disease, arranging medical treatments
accordingly and alert health officials in advance which potentially
stops to become pandemic.

World Health Organization (WHO) plays an important role in keeping watch
on such diseases as it occurs across the world. They established
\href{http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/en/}{Global
Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)} in 1952 to monitor
Influenza and different strains and changes in viruses with the goal of
reducing its impact and providing guidance to researchers to
develop/enhance vaccine. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
WHO works together to contain the virus and protect older population in
the country.

With this initial background this case study provides different insights
from the \href{https://apps.who.int/flumart/Default?ReportNo=12}{data}
that is publicly available on WHO's website. Study will analyze trends
in the data to develop model to 2 week forecast of infections details of
which is available in later section of this document.
