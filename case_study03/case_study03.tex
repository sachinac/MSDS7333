\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\textbf{E}mail spams are unsolicited emails that also referred as Junk
emails sent in bulk. There is no law at least in United States that
prevents anybody from sending unsolicited emails whether in single email
or in bulk. Research indicate that email spams are accounted for over
80\% of total email traffic.\(^{[2][3][4]}\). First commercial spam
incident was reported in 1994 \(^{[5]}\). That email message was sent to
393 recipients advertising new model of VMS-DEC computer. There are
different forms of email spams or unsolicited emails that may affect
either individuals or organizations. Following are the few of them :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Commercial Advertisements
\item
  Hoax emails
\item
  Emails Spoofs or phishing
\item
  Lottery winining notification is very common
\item
  Money Scams
\item
  Virus/Malware
\item
  Fills inbox
\item
  Potentially steals private information
\item
  Privacy concerns.
\end{itemize}

All these can adversely affect individual as well as organizations. Such
emails comes from unknown sources that we never interacted with or
sometimes spammers use spoofing techniques to mislead recipients to
appear as valid source. Organizations also takes advantage to send bulk
emails to potential customers to advertise their products.Such bulk
emails occupies network traffic all the time. As far as personal email
box goes human can easily categorize such emails and trash them
manually. But nowadays there so many spams that it becomes hard to
maintain email box without junk. That's where automated spam filters
turns out to be very useful. Such a spam filters automatically detects
spams and moves them to separate folder.Google for example and many
other mailbox providers do run their own spam filters.

Now a days different machine learning algorithm are used for detecting
and daily inspecting for incoming emails by different email provider
companies like google, yahoo and the like. Among these machine learning
algorithms decision tree methods are one of the best list.

\section{Business Understanding}\label{business-understanding}}

The two common approaches used for filtering spam mails are knowledge
engineering and machine learning. Emails are classified as either spam
or ham using a set of rules in knowledge engineering \(^{[4]}\). Machine
learning approach have proved to be more efficient than knowledge
engineering approach. No rule is required to be specified, rather a set
of training samples which are pre-classified email messages are
provided. A particular machine learning algorithm is then used to learn
the classification rules from these email messages.

Machine learning algorithms use statistical models to classify data. In
the case of spam detection, a trained machine learning model must be
able to determine whether the sequence of words found in an email are
closer to those found in spam emails or safe ones.

Several studies have been carried out on machine learning techniques and
many of these algorithms are being applied in the field of email spam
filtering. Examples of such algorithms include Deep Learning, NaÃ¯ve
Bayes, Decision tree, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks,
K-Nearest Neighbor, Rough sets, and Random Forests.

For this case study we are implementing a decision tree algorithm.
Decision trees provides some unique advantages over other ML algorithms
like Naive Bayes, SVM, kNN etc. Some of the aspect are expored as a part
of current work. The approach uses a decision tree to go from
observations associated with the email to target classification of being
spam or not a spam. We explore a decision tree package in R called
rpart, which is short for recursive partitioning.

\hypertarget{objective}{%
\subsection{Objective}\label{objective}}

Our objective is to investigate and optimize key hyperparameters used in
the rpart package in order to classify email messages as spam or Ham
email. In order to accomplish this, we fit a default decision tree and
an optimized decision tree and compare them.

\section{Data Evaluation /
Engineering}\label{data-evaluation-engineering}}

The dataset provided for this cases study was preprocessed and labeled
already and contains features extracted from after preprocessing. It
contains total of 9348 unique emails with 29 predictor variables and one
response variable named isSpam. Of the 30 total variables, 17 are
boolean factor variables and the remaining 13 variables are numeric
variables. Each email has been previously classified as spam or valid.
This dataset will be used to build a model using decision trees to
classify email messages as spam or ham. Details of each feature is as
follows:

Interpretation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  noHost is missing on single record when all other values are present
\item
  subSpamWords \& isYelling are missing on same 7 records when all other
  values are present
\item
  subExcCt, subQuesCt, subBlanks appears to be missing on same 20
  records
\item
  It is observed that 13 of 20 rows in subBlanks are NaN.
\item
  numRec has missing values on 282 records most likely due to recipients
  were added in BCC and only 12 emails have been flagged as Spam and
  remaining 270 are not spam. These 282 missing values are appears to be
  random and satisfies MAR (Missing at Random). Missing values will be
  fixed using mean imputation for both categories (Spam and not Spam)
  seperately.

\subsection{Train/Test split}\label{traintest-split}}

Original data to be split into train(0.8) and test set (0.2). R package
caret provides library function createDataPartition to split data into
train/test set and it performs stratified sampling by default as per its
documentation. Stratified sampling technique preserves percentage of
samples of each class. Target variable in this case is binary i.e.~email
could either be Spam or not Spam and only approximately 25\% emails have
been labeled as Spam therefore Stratified sampling is the best way to
proceed.

\hypertarget{train---target-percentage-distribution}{%
\subsubsection{Train - Target Percentage
Distribution}\label{train---target-percentage-distribution}}

\textbf{createDataPartition} function from \textbf{caret} packages was
used to split data into train/test set.Target variable is binary and
distribution of classes is not balanced. i.e.~70\% observations are not
spam and only 30\% are labeled as Spam in this dataset. This is case of
imbalanced dataset. Random Stratified sampling has been used to split
data into train/test set for building model using decision trees.
\textbf{Stratified Sampling} preserves the percentage of samples of each
class. Scaling and normalization is required for decision tree models.

\hypertarget{constraints}{%
\subsection{Constraints}\label{constraints}}

Following are limitations of Decision tree algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Decision Tree algorithms are greedy algorithms, prone to
  overfitting.If not handled properly tree tends to grow larger and
  become complex and difficult to interpret. Overfitting affects
  generalizability and hence accuracy of prediction goes down
  significantly.
\item
  Trees are unstable, meaning that even small change in information
  leads to big change in trees.
\item
  Loses lot of information in splitting process.
\item
  Bad for large datasets
\end{itemize}

However, there are different ways to tackle these problems.
Hyperparameter tunining, building stopping criteria are discussed in
next sections.

\hypertarget{modeling-preparations}{%
\section{Modeling Preparations}\label{modeling-preparations}}

\hypertarget{approaches}{%
\subsection{Approaches:}\label{approaches}}

Two approaches were under consideration for email SPAM classification
problem, (1) NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and (2) decision tree (DT) based approach.
These are discussed below and a case is made for use of decision tree
for modeling problem. NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) requires or assumes an underlying
probabilistic model. This is not a requirement for decision tree. In
contrast to NB approach, decision tree algorithms are relatively easier
to understand in terms of understanding classification algorithm, and
also provides easy identification of important features, and handling of
missing values. In DT based approach it is easier to accommodate
additional derived features from an email (e.g.~number of forwards,
number of capital letters in subject line, etc.), and not just the word
content. To explore and capture above, DT based approach is pursued in
this work.

\hypertarget{classification-metrics}{%
\subsection{Classification Metrics:}\label{classification-metrics}}

For the binary classification problem at hand, with goal of predicting
if Email is SPAM or NOT, we have following confusion matrix
interpretation:

While accuracy is a default metric for better classification, for
current problem we need to discuss importance of FP (False Positive) and
FN (False Negative) scenarios to identify metrics:

\textbf{False Positive (FP) rate needs to be minimized.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is the number of times Email is classified as SPAM, while actually
  it was not.
\item
  Goal is that the SPAM filter should not automatically block emails by
  classifying them as SPAM, when they actually are not. Otherwise, users
  could end up loosing a lot of important emails.
\item
  This implies that specificity given by \(\frac{TN}{TN+FP}\) =
  \textasciitilde1, or as high as possible.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{False Negative (FN) rate should be minimized, but is less
critical than FP rate.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is the number of times Email is classified as Ham, while actually
  it was SPAM.
\item
  FN rate is less critical than FP rate, as we can occasionally allow
  SPAM messages to reach end user, as long as we get better model,
  i.e.~a very low FP rate.
\item
  It is assumed that that the end person can exercise judgement and
  categorize such emails as SPAM, and take corrective actions as per
  company's IT policy.
\end{itemize}

Above arguments lead us to select following metrics to be considered
while choosing the best model:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Specificity, or True Negative Rate (TNR)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Given \(TNR=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}\)
  \item
    Minimizing FP, implies we need to select model with highest TNR
    values
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Precision, or Positive Predictive Value (PPV)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Given \(PPV=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\)
  \item
    Minimizing FP, implies we need to select model with highest PPV
    values
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There is additional flexibility in choosing model with a slightly poorer
recall, or sensitivity \(\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\) as cost of FP is larger than
FN, and focus is minimizing FP over FN.

Lastly, we have an imbalanced classification problem at hand. Refer
Figure above, that shows that \textasciitilde75\% outcomes are HAM,
while \textasciitilde25\% outcomes are SPAM in modeling dataset. Due to
above, and to provide a better balance between precision and recall, F1
metric is additionally chosen as a metric for choosing the best model.
F1 is harmonic mean of `Precision' and `Recall' and given by

\(\frac{2*Precision*Recall}{Precision+Recall}\)

F1 score penalizes if any one of precision or recall falls low, which
may also happen due to imbalanced classification problem at hand when
attempting k-fold cross validation. Basic Tree Model \& Parameters

Parameters tuned for our basic tree are mentioned below along with
description: minsplit - the minimum number of observations that must
exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted minbucket - the
minimum number of observations in any terminal node cp - complexity
parameter. Any split that does not decrease the overall lack of ï¬t by a
factor of cp is not attempted. A high cp value implies a split is
attempted only if information gain is larger by amount cp.~Choosing a
higher value of cp reduces number of tree splits, as fewer splits will
meet the high bar on information gain as set by high cp parameter.

In our analysis above parameters are varied.

\newpage

\hypertarget{model-building-evaluation}{%
\section{Model Building \& Evaluation}\label{model-building-evaluation}}

Decision tree algorithm are prone to overfit quickly and loses
generalizability for prediction i.e.~prediction performance become poor.
Solution to this problem is hyperparameter tuning. Decision trees have
several hyparameters that can be tuned to get optimal model. Below table
lists important hyperparameters of which minsplit,minbucket, cp and
maxdepth will be used here to tune the model. These are the stopping
criterion for the trees which can be applied at each stage during
tree-building process.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{30em}}
\toprule
HyperParameters & Description\\
\midrule
minsplit & Minimum number of observations required to split the given node. If it is set to 20 indicates that if data has less than 20 records then root node becomes leaf
                   node.\\
minbucket & Minimum number of observations required at leaf node. default is minbucket = minsplit/3\\
cp & Complexity Parameter to control size of the tree and also known as cost of adding another variable to decision tree\\
maxdepth & Set the maximum depth of any node of the final tree\\
maxsurrogate & Used if data contains missing values. useful to determine which split can be used for missing data\\
\addlinespace
usesurrogate & Controls use of surrogate split\\
surrogatestyle & Controls selection of best surrogate\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\emph{getParamSet(tree)} function from \textbf{R package mlr} returns
following list of hyper-parameters for the decision tree.

\textbf{Tuned Parameters}

Parameters are tuned with following criteria

\begin{itemize}

\item
  5 \textless= minsplit \textless=20
\item
  3 \textless= minbucket \textless=10
\item
  3 \textless= maxdepth \textless=10
\item
  0.01 \textless= cp \textless=0.1
\item

\item

\end{itemize}

Here are tuning results:

\begin{verbatim}
Tune result:

f1.test.mean=0.9379524,tpr.test.mean=0.9496755,ppv.test.mean=0.9266441,tnr.test.mean=0.7823693
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Impact of hyper parameter tuning on model's performance}

Model performance metric variation as a function of tuning parameters is
analyzed through plots below.

\emph{Impact due to Complexity Parameter (cp)}

Complexity parameter controls the tree growth, and additional splits at
a level are attempted only if information gain is larger by amount cp.~

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Higher cp value puts a larger requirement on information gain with
  every split, leading to smaller trees.
\item
  Smaller cp values lower thre requirement on information gain with
  every split, leading to larger trees.
\end{itemize}

As can be seen from figure below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Smaller cp values, lead to better or improved metric (F1 score)
\item
  For maxdepth upto 4, reducing cp does not improve the metric, which is
  intuitive, as tree stops to grow. However increasing maxdepth
  \textgreater{} 4 allows better metric.
\end{itemize}

Clearly maxdepth and cp directly help control and influence the
classification model metrics.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{case_study03_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-23-1} \end{center}

\emph{Impact due to Minsplit and Minbucket}

Minsplit is the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node
in order for a split to be attempted.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Smaller value is expected to lead to tree growth.
\end{itemize}

Minbucket is the minimum number of observations in any terminal node

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Smaller value is expected to lead to tree growdth
\end{itemize}

However, Minsplit and Minbucket oppose each other sometimes, and may
render other value redundant. E.g. minsplit has to be larger than
minbucket for both of the parameters to operate independently.

Looking at impact of Minsplit and Minbucket on F1 metric, refer figure
below, does not indicate that they play a major role in determining
model score like F1. It is clear that cp value is what drives the model
performance.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{case_study03_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-24-1} \end{center}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{case_study03_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-25-1} \end{center}

\textbf{Model Performance of Tuned Model}

Tuned decision tree has following hyperparamter values:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  minsplit = 8
\item
  minbucket = 3
\item
  cp = 0.0125
\item
  maxdepth = 9
\end{itemize}

classification task.

\section{Model Interpretability \&
Explainability}\label{model-interpretability-explainability}}

Most important features from the model that was built after 10 fold
cross validation and hyperparameter tuning is as shown below. While
building model using decision trees assigns scores to these variables.
Feature scores gives us clear picture which features tree found most
important. So for this particular model we can clearly see feature
perCaps (percentatge uppercase letters ) is the most important feature
followed by numLines (number of lines per message),perHTML(percentage
HTML tags),numDlr (Number of dollar symbol). As per this model perCaps
is the most deciding factor to know if email is spam or not then number
of lines and percentage of HTML tags.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{case_study03_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-28-1} \caption{Feature importance}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-28}
\end{figure}

The most importatn feature is perCaps (Percentage capital letters in the
body of the message) and least important feature is isPGPsigned
(Signature). perCaps contributes more than any other features. Almost
600 emails have been flagged as a Spam while numLines contributes little
less than 400 towards Spams out of total emails. This is quite what we
see on daily basis all such Spams contains capital letters. This bar
plot is quite intuative and self explanatory.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{case_study03_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-29-1} \caption{Decision Tree}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-29}
\end{figure}

Interpreting trees is quite straightforward. One just need to answer
series of questions to go to bottom of the tree to classify message as
Spam or not Spam.

\textbf{Example 1}

Here is one example randomly picked up from the dataset and let's
walkthrough the tree from top to bottom of the tree by answering
questions.

\begin{verbatim}
  isSpam  perCaps numLines  perHTML numDlr forwards isInReplyTo isRe
1      T 38.47865      101 42.38749      0 1.980198           F    F
\end{verbatim}

Q1 - Is perCaps \textgreater{} 13

A1 - Yes PerCaps = 38.47 \textgreater{} 13 move to right branch

Q2 - is numLines \textgreater{} 9.5

A2 - Indeed numLines = 101 \textgreater9.5 move to right branch

Q3 - is isInReplyTo T or F

A3 - its False go to the right branch and this is leaf node.

By answering just three questions we concluded that email is Spam email.
This is real advantage of decision trees. They superbly interpretable
compared to other models.

\textbf{Example 2}

Here is another example for email that is not a spam.

\begin{verbatim}
  isSpam  perCaps numLines perHTML numDlr forwards isInReplyTo isRe
1      F 4.451039       50       0      3        0           T    T
\end{verbatim}

Q1 - Is perCaps \textless{} 13

A1 - Yes perCaps= 4.45 \textless{} 13 move towards left Subtree

Q2 - Is perHTML \textless{} 3.9

A2 - Yes perHTML=0 \textless{} 3.9 move towards left Subtree

Q3 - Is forwards \textgreater{} 1.2

A3 - No forwards=0 \textless{} 1.2 move towards right Subtree

Q4 - Is isInReplyTo = T ?

A4 - isInReplyTo = T move towards left subtree and this is leaf node
which tells us that this email is not a Spam.

Again by answering just four questions we concluded that email is not a
Spam.

\newpage

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

An Email SPAM filtering model is developed that is capable of accurately
identifying SPAM 90\% of time, and with a true negative rate, or
specificity at 95\%. This implies very few times a non-SPAM email gets
classified as SPAM.

A decision tree based classification approach is developed that can be
deployed alongside automatic reading of email and doing a real time
check to categorize email as a SPAM or not SPAM.

The model used following variables for classification of email in SPAM:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  forwards
\item
  perCaps
\item
  perHTML
\item
  numLines
\item
  numDlr
\item
  subBlanks
\item
  isInReplyTo
\end{itemize}

An email is classifies as SPAM when any of following rule is met:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  perCaps \textgreater= 13 , and numLines \textgreater{} 9.5, and,
  isInReplyTo is false
\item
  perCaps \textless{} 13 , and perHTML \textgreater{} 3.9, and numLines
  \textgreater{} 242
\item
  perCaps \textless{} 13 , and perHTML \textless{} 3.9, and \#forwards
  \textless{} 1.2., and numDlr \textgreater= 0.5, isInReplyTo is false,
  and, numLines \textless{} 103
\item
  perCaps \textless{} 13 , and perHTML \textless{} 3.9, and \#forwards
  \textless{} 1.2., and numDlr \textless{} 0.5 , isInReplyTo is true,
  and, subBlanks \textgreater=25
\item
  perCaps \textless{} 13 , and perHTML \textless{} 3.9, and \#forwards
  \textless{} 1.2., and numDlr \textless{} 0.5 , isInReplyTo is true,
  and, subBlanks \textless{} 25, and subExcCt \textgreater=0.5 and
  numLines \textgreater{} 17
\item
  perCaps \textless{} 13 , and perHTML \textless{} 3.9, and \#forwards
  \textless{} 1.2., and numDlr \textless{} 0.5 , isInReplyTo is true,
  and, subBlanks \textless{} 25, and subExcCt \textless{} 0.5 and isDear
  = 2
\end{itemize}

Decision trees are super interpretable compared to other
models/algorithms, For future work Naive Bayes, SVM, Stockastic models
could also be explored and benchmarked for model performance.
